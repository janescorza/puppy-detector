## Unleash Your Inner Dog Detective 🐶🕵️‍♂️ with This Deep Learning Puppy Detector!✨🐾

This repository houses the code for a **puppy detector** I have built entirely from scratch using **Python and my Deep Learning skills**. This sipmle project aims to **distinguish between images of genuine puppies and imposters** (other animals or objects) using a neural network model.

🤔 **Why Build from Scratch?** 🤔

This project goes beyond using pre-built libraries like TensorFlow. Instead, it focuses on understanding the core principles of neural networks. Building it from scratch allowed me to:

* 💡**Demonstrate Chore My Understanding**💡: This project demonstrates my understanding of neural network implementation, showcasing my learning journey.
* ⚙️**Grasp the Intricate Workings of Neural Networks**⚙️: Understanding the "how" and "why" behind neural networks empowers me to optimize them effectively.
* 🔨**Experiment and Refine**🔨: Understanding the core mechanics enables me to explore diverse optimization techniques and fine-tune the model for superior performance.

✨Key Optimizations✨:

* **He initialization** for weights : This sets weights with a standard deviation that's more suitable for ReLU activations, helping avoid "dying neurons" and improving convergence speed.

* **Adam optimizer** for efficient updates : Adam combines the benefits of momentum and adaptive learning rates for faster and smoother convergence, often outperforming basic gradient descent.

* **Mini-batch gradient descent** (Breaking data into smaller chunks): This enables faster updates and often improves generalization, as the model sees a more diverse set of examples in each iteration.
