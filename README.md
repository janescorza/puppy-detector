## Puppy Detector: Identifying the Goodest boys with Deep Learning 

This repository houses the code for a **puppy detector** built entirely from scratch using **Python and my Deep Learning skills**. This sipmle project aims to **distinguish between images of genuine puppies and imposters** (other animals or objects) using a neural network model.

**Highlights:**

* **Built from scratch:** This project demonstrates the implementation of neural network from the ground up, showcasing my learning so far.
* **Python-based:** Rather than going for Tensorflow, I chose to use Python and numPy to showcase how I understand the chore of NNs.
* **Core optimization techniques:** The code implements core optimization techniques, providing improvements to what would be the base model performance.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/janescorza/puppy-detector.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python puppy_detector.py
   ```

**Disclaimer:**

This is a basic project and the included model may not achieve perfect accuracy. It's intended as a learning exercise and can be further improved with more data, advanced architectures, and hyperparameter tuning.

**Feel free to explore the code, contribute to its development, and experiment with your Deep Learning knowledge!**

**Additional Notes:**

* This README file serves as a basic template. You can customize it further by adding details such as the specific Deep Learning libraries used (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) and the model architecture (e.g., Convolutional Neural Network).
* Consider including links to relevant resources such as tutorials or documentation for the libraries and concepts used.
